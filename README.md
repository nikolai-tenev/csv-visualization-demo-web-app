# Demo web application for CSV upload and visualization.

I developed this application as a demo. 
It's developed with React.js, MobX, Material UI amongst others. It has user authentication (login and register) and simple functionality that enables the user to upload and save CSV files, create and save visualizations for the data in those files and also create PDF files from the saved visualizations.
It also has a simple dashboard page with visualizations shown selected by the user.
